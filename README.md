In the initial data preparation phase, meticulous optimization of the HR dataset was the primary focus. The following tasks were performed: 

- Data Loading and Inspection
- Redundant columns were eliminated
- Labels were clarified
- Duplicates were resolved
- Inconsistencies across columns were standardized.
- Addressing NaN values was crucial to ensure data accuracy, establishing a strong foundation for analysis.




- ### 📝 Data Analysis
  ```Measures
  Active Employees = SUM('HR-Employee-Attrition'[Employee Count])- SUM('HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attraction Count])
  ```
  ```
  Attrition Count = SWITCH(true(), 'HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition]="Yes",1, 'HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition]="No",0,0)
  ```
  ```
  Total Attrition = COUNT('HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition])
  ```
